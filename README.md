Project 1 - Sonar - 
Title: Sonar Dataset Analysis for Mine vs. Rock Classification Using Logistic Regression

Introduction:
In this project, we delve into the fascinating realm of underwater object classification using the Sonar dataset. Our aim is to develop a robust predictive model to discern between two classes of objects: mines and rocks. This task holds significant importance in various fields such as marine navigation, defense, and environmental monitoring. To achieve this, we employ the Logistic Regression algorithm, a powerful tool commonly used for binary classification tasks.

Dataset Overview:
The Sonar dataset comprises sonar signals bounced off different objects submerged in the ocean. Each sample in the dataset is characterized by 60 features representing the strength of the sonar returns at different angles. The target variable indicates whether the object is a mine (M) or a rock (R).

Methodology:

Data Preprocessing: We begin by exploring the dataset, checking for missing values, and performing necessary data cleaning. Feature scaling might also be applied to normalize the data.
Feature Selection: Depending on the dataset's characteristics, feature selection techniques such as correlation analysis or dimensionality reduction methods like PCA could be employed to enhance model performance.
Model Training: We split the dataset into training and testing sets. Then, we train a Logistic Regression model using the training data.
Model Evaluation: The trained model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the testing set. Additionally, ROC curve analysis can be conducted to assess the model's discrimination ability.
Model Optimization: Hyperparameter tuning techniques like Grid Search or Random Search can be utilized to optimize the model's performance further.
Interpretation: We interpret the model coefficients to understand the importance of each feature in predicting mine or rock.
Results:
Upon completion of the aforementioned steps, we obtain a well-performing logistic regression model capable of accurately classifying underwater objects as mines or rocks. The model's performance metrics demonstrate its efficacy in distinguishing between the two classes.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, this project showcases the application of Logistic Regression in classifying underwater objects based on sonar signals. By leveraging the Sonar dataset, we have developed a reliable model for mine vs. rock classification, contributing to the advancement of underwater object detection technologies. This endeavor underscores the importance of machine learning in addressing real-world challenges across diverse domains.
